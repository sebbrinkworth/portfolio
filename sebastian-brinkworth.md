## Summary
QA automation and full-stack engineer with 5+ years building TypeScript web apps and production-grade test automation. I design Playwright frameworks and LLM-assisted workflows for test generation and review (prompting, agent decomposition, context management) that improve throughput without compromising determinism or maintainability. Experienced across Angular/React, backend services (.NET/Java/Spring Boot), and release-validation automation such as data integrity assertions and cross-environment verification.
